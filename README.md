# Melanoma-Classification-and-Segmentation

Dataset contained colour Melanoma and Non-Melanoma images, along with the correct binary masks.
Image segmentation was performed to classify each pixel into one of two classes (background and non-background).
For classification, the masks were applied to all the images and classification into Melanoma and Non-Melanoma was done.
